# Kelp's SE Image converter

This app is fresh out the oven, expect some bugs and other nasty things. If you do find any, please let me know about it via the issues tab above.

This app is also directly inspired by [Whip's image converter](https://github.com/Whiplash141/Whips-Image-Converter). The main reason I decided to write my own is that I wanted to be able to convert images while playing the game on Linux via Proton. But, if there's a need for it, I might implement extra features that are requested.

# How do I download this program?

# Screen sizes

Since SE has blessed us with a multitude of screens to display text in, each of them with their own, custom sizes, I created a table that contains the size preset needed for proper image sizing. You can find it [here](https://github.com/nojusr/kelp-SE-image-converter/blob/main/Screen-Size-Guide.md)
